This project is Postiz, a tool to schedule social media and chat posts to 28+ channels.
You can add posts to the calendar, they will be added into a workflow and posted at the right time.
You can find things like:
- Schedule posts
- Calendar view
- Analytics
- Team management
- Media library

This project is a monorepo with a root only package.json of dependencies.
Made with PNPM.
We have 3 important folders

- apps/backend - this is where the API code is (NESTJS)
- apps/orchestrator - this is temporal, it's for background jobs (NESTJS) it contains all the workflows and activities
- apps/frontend - this is the code of the frontend (Vite ReactJS)
- /libraries contains a lot of services shared between backend and orchestrator and frontend components.

We are using only pnpm, don't use any other dependency manager.
Never install frontend components from npmjs, focus on writing native components.

The project uses tailwind 3, before writing any component look at:
- /apps/frontend/src/app/colors.scss
- /apps/frontend/src/app/global.scss
- /apps/frontend/tailwind.config.js

All the --color-custom* are deprecated, don't use them.

And check other components in the system before to get the right design.

When working on the backend we need to pass the 3 layers:
Controller >> Service >> Repository (no shortcuts)
In some cases we will have
Controller >> Mananger >> Service >> Repository.

Most of the server logic should be inside of libs/server.
The backend repository is mostly used to write controller, and import files from libs.server.

For the frontend follow this:
- Many of the UI components lives in /apps/frontend/src/components/ui
- Routing is in /apps/frontend/src/app
- Components are in /apps/frontend/src/components
- always use SWR to fetch stuff, and use "useFetch" hook from /libraries/helpers/src/utils/custom.fetch.tsx

When using SWR, each one have to be in a seperate hook and must comply with react-hooks/rules-of-hooks, never put eslint-disable-next-line on it.

It means that this is valid:
const useCommunity = () => {
   return useSWR....
}

This is not valid:
const useCommunity = () => {
  return {
    communities: () => useSWR<CommunitiesListResponse>("communities", getCommunities),
    providers: () => useSWR<ProvidersListResponse>("providers", getProviders),
  };
}

- Linting of the project can run only from the root.
- Use only pnpm.

## Workflow Orchestration

### 1. Plan Node Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately – don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

### 2. Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project

### 4. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes – don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests – then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

## Task Management

1. **Plan First**: Write plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items
2. **Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation
3. **Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go
4. **Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step
5. **Document Results**: Add review section to `tasks/todo.md`
6. **Capture Lessons**: Update `tasks/lessons.md` after corrections

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.
